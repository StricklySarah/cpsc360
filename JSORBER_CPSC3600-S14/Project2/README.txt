Known problems:

	My program doesn't read multiple answers. And it doesn't read the IP address correctly. It also print a junk charater before each lable, I probably could have fixed this issue but it didn't occur on my laptop but did when I ran it on the lab computers.

Design: 

	I created a header function to create the header section. I created query function to create the query. I created another function to parse the answer header and gather the correct data. Then I created a function to parse the name, which is recersive. Finally I created a function to parse the information about the answer.
